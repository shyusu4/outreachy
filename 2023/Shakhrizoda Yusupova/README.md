**Hi everyone!**

I'm Shakhrizoda, you can call me Sherry though :)
I was raised in Dubai, UAE, and later I moved to my homeland, Tashkent, Uzbekistan. You may not have heard of Uzbekistan, so let me give you a brief description: it’s a doubly landlocked country in Central Asia with some pretty cool architecture, and even better food ➡️ And I’m currently based in Istanbul, Türkiye.

I got into tech during my time at university when I took a C++ course (honestly I wasn't a fan) I somehow completed the course, even though I found it challenging. Not so long after that course, I discovered web development and decided to give it a shot to see if it was any easier than C++. I actually enjoyed it, so I went through a full stack bootcamp where I learned JS, HTML, CSS, React, and RoR.

Recently I've been volunteering as a frontend dev on a tech squad at @cherryontech, where we’ve been working on a web app that helps diverse learners see themselves in STEM fields and remind them that they belong. Our idea is sort of similar to Outreachy, which is why I was tempted to apply in the first place!

I’m so glad I made it to the contribution stage, and I’m looking forward to contributing to a project, whether it’s wagtail.org website accessibility or accessibility features documentation (I’m still not sure because I’m new to Django)
